## [Unreleased]

### Added
- 📡 **MQTT + Home Assistant Auto-Discovery**: Native MQTT client with full HA integration
  - **27 auto-discovered entities** in Home Assistant via MQTT Discovery protocol
  - **11 sensors**: Battery level, brightness, WiFi SSID, WiFi signal, light sensor, IP address, app version, memory used, storage free, current URL, volume
  - **6 binary sensors**: Screen on/off, screensaver active, battery charging, kiosk mode, device owner, motion detected
  - **2 number controls**: Brightness (0-100%), volume (0-100%) — adjustable sliders in HA
  - **2 switches**: Screen power (ON/OFF), screensaver (ON/OFF)
  - **5 buttons**: Reload, wake, reboot, clear cache, lock
  - **1 text entity**: Navigate URL — send a URL to load in the WebView
  - **20 additional commands** via MQTT: TTS, toast, audio play/stop/beep, launch app, execute JS, URL rotation start/stop, restart UI
  - **Push-based status**: Periodic state publishing (configurable 5-3600 seconds, default 30s)
  - **LWT (Last Will & Testament)**: Automatic availability tracking — HA shows device as unavailable on disconnect
  - **Auto-reconnect**: Handles WiFi drops and broker restarts with automatic re-publishing of all discovery configs
  - **Always-on Motion Detection**: Configurable option to run camera-based motion detection continuously (not just during screensaver)
  - **Full command parity** with REST API — both interfaces dispatch through the same command handler
  - **Concurrent operation**: MQTT and REST API can run simultaneously
  - Eclipse Paho MQTT v3.1.1 with secure password storage (Android Keychain)
  - Settings: Broker URL, port, username, password, client ID, base topic, discovery prefix, status interval, allow control
  - Connection status indicator in Settings UI
  - MQTT settings included in backup/restore
  - **[Full MQTT Documentation](docs/MQTT.md)**
### Fixed
- 🔧 **Camera/Microphone not working in WebView on Fire OS** (Echo Show, Fire tablets) (#63): auto-grant WebView media/geolocation permissions in kiosk mode — OS-level permission via `pm grant` still required


***

## [1.2.12] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- 🔒 **Screen lock without Device Owner**: `screen/off` and `lock` now work with Device Admin or AccessibilityService
  - 4-tier fallback: Device Owner `lockNow()` → **Device Admin `lockNow()`** → AccessibilityService `GLOBAL_ACTION_LOCK_SCREEN` (API 28+) → dim brightness to 0
  - `dpm.lockNow()` is available to Device Admin apps (API 8+), not just Device Owner — was an oversight
  - Enables full FreeKiosk screen control when another MDM already holds Device Owner
  - Truly turns off the screen (hardware off) with any of the 3 first tiers
  - Wake-up cycle (`screen/on`, AlarmManager, WakeLock) unchanged and fully compatible
  - `/api/lock` and `screen/off` response now includes `"method"` field (`"DeviceOwner"`, `"DeviceAdmin"`, or `"AccessibilityService"`)

- **Inline PDF Viewer**: PDFs now open directly in-app via a bundled PDF.js viewer instead of being downloaded
  - Enabled via a toggle in **Settings → General → PDF Viewer**
  - Uses **PDF.js v3.11.174** bundled locally in Android assets — no Google Docs, no external service
  - Full viewer UI: page navigation (◀/▶), zoom (−/⊡/+), close (✕), and download (⬇) buttons
  - **Download button** triggers the native Android `DownloadManager` (notification + Downloads folder)
  - Intercepts PDF links at 3 levels:
    1. **JS injection**: strips `<a download>` attributes so Android's DownloadListener doesn't fire early
    2. **`onShouldStartLoadWithRequest`**: redirects `.pdf` URLs and Google redirect URLs (`google.com/url?url=...`) to the viewer
    3. **Native `DownloadListener` patch** (`RNCWebViewManagerImpl.kt`): intercepts PDFs detected by `Content-Type: application/pdf` or `Content-Disposition: attachment` and loads the viewer instead of downloading
  - **Native HTTP proxy** (`RNCWebViewClient.java` `shouldInterceptRequest`): when the viewer is active, proxies all remote PDF XHR requests via `HttpURLConnection` to bypass CORS restrictions — cookies and `Range` headers forwarded
  - Security: `allowFileAccess` / `allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` only enabled when PDF viewer is on
  - All patches saved in `patches/react-native-webview+13.16.0.patch` via `patch-package`

- ♿ **AccessibilityService for cross-app key injection**: New `FreeKioskAccessibilityService` enables keyboard emulation in External App mode
  - Uses `performGlobalAction()` for Back/Home/Recents navigation (all Android versions)
  - Uses `InputMethod.sendKeyEvent()` / `commitText()` for keys and text on Android 13+ (API 33+)
  - Fallback for Android 5–12: `ACTION_SET_TEXT` injects printable characters, text, Backspace, and Shift+letter
  - `KeyCharacterMap` converts keyCodes to printable characters for the ACTION_SET_TEXT fallback
  - Automatic fallback chain: AccessibilityService → Activity `dispatchKeyEvent()` → `input keyevent` (last resort)
  - **Settings UI**: New "Accessibility Service" section in Advanced Settings with:
    - Status indicator (Active / Enabled / Disabled)
    - "Open Accessibility Settings" button to launch Android's settings
    - "Enable Automatically" button for Device Owner mode (no user interaction needed)
    - Info box explaining why the service is needed
  - Compatible with privacy ROMs (e/OS, LineageOS, CalyxOS, GrapheneOS) where `Instrumentation` is blocked

### Fixed
- 🔑 **Key injection compatibility fix**: Replaced `Instrumentation.sendKeyDownUpSync()` with `activity.dispatchKeyEvent()` across all remote/keyboard endpoints
  - `Instrumentation` requires `INJECT_EVENTS` (signature-level permission) which privacy-focused ROMs (e/OS, LineageOS, CalyxOS, GrapheneOS) block
  - `dispatchKeyEvent()` dispatches directly into the Activity's View hierarchy — no special permission needed
  - Affects: `/api/remote/*` (all 9 keys), `/api/remote/keyboard/{key}`, `/api/remote/keyboard?map=...`, `/api/remote/text`
  - Also fixed in `KioskModule.sendRemoteKey()` (used by JS-side remote control)
  - No regression on standard ROMs (Samsung, Pixel, AOSP)

## [1.2.11] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Emulation API**: Full keyboard input simulation via REST API ([#keyboard](https://github.com/FreeKiosk/FreeKiosk/issues))
  - **Single key press** (`GET|POST /api/remote/keyboard/{key}`): Send any keyboard key
    - Supports: a-z, 0-9, F1-F12, space, tab, enter, escape, backspace, delete, arrows, symbols, media keys
    - Over 80 named keys + single character support
  - **Keyboard shortcuts** (`GET|POST /api/remote/keyboard?map=ctrl+c`): Send key combinations with modifiers
    - Supports: ctrl, alt, shift, meta (Windows/Cmd key)
    - Examples: `ctrl+c`, `ctrl+v`, `alt+f4`, `ctrl+shift+a`
  - **Text input** (`POST /api/remote/text`): Type full text strings into focused input fields
    - Body: `{"text": "Hello World!"}`
    - Uses `Instrumentation.sendStringSync()` for natural text input
  - All keyboard operations handled natively (no JS bridge — fast and reliable)
- 📍 **GPS Location API** (`GET /api/location`): New endpoint for device GPS coordinates
  - Returns: latitude, longitude, accuracy, altitude, speed, bearing, provider, timestamp
  - Uses GPS, Network, and Passive location providers (best accuracy wins)
  - Permissions already declared in manifest (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` + `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`)
- 🔋 **Enriched Battery API**: `GET /api/battery` now returns additional data
  - New fields: `temperature` (°C), `voltage` (V), `health` (good/overheat/dead/etc.), `technology` (Li-ion/etc.)
  - Backward compatible: existing `level`, `charging`, `plugged` fields unchanged
- 🔒 **Lock Device API** (`GET|POST /api/lock`): New endpoint to lock the device screen
  - Uses `DevicePolicyManager.lockNow()` for a true screen lock (Device Owner required)
  - Returns clear error message if Device Owner mode is not active
- 🔄 **Restart UI API** (`GET|POST /api/restart-ui`): New endpoint to restart the app UI
  - Calls `activity.recreate()` to fully restart the React Native activity
  - Useful for remote troubleshooting without rebooting the device
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Fully implemented native TTS via Android `TextToSpeech` engine
  - TTS engine is initialized when the HTTP server starts
  - Handled natively (no JS bridge dependency — works even if React Native is unresponsive)
  - Auto-retries if TTS engine is not ready on first call
- 📊 **Volume Read API** (`GET /api/volume`): New endpoint to read current volume level
  - Returns `{ level: 0-100, maxLevel: 100 }` for easy integration with Home Assistant sensors

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Screen Sleep Scheduler - Black Screen & Navigation Lockout**: Fixed 4 critical bugs causing scheduler to malfunction
  - **Feedback loop**: Scheduler re-entered sleep immediately after wake due to `isScheduledSleep` in useEffect dependency array
  - **Navigation lockout**: Scheduler interval kept running while on PIN/Settings screen, calling `lockNow()` and locking user out
  - **Wake-on-touch broken**: Touch events during sleep did nothing — never restored brightness or called `exitScheduledSleep()`
  - **Stale closure**: `checkScreenSchedule()` used outdated state variable instead of ref
  - **N-tap during sleep**: 5-tap for settings now properly exits scheduled sleep before navigating to PIN
  - **Activity null after lockNow()**: `turnScreenOn()` now acquires WakeLock before checking for activity availability
  - Fixes black screen issue on Android 8.1+ and impossible settings access during sleep windows
- 🐛 **Power menu dismissed immediately on some devices (TECNO/HiOS)**: Fixed GlobalActions (power menu) being closed ~900ms after appearing when "Allow Power Button" is enabled in Lock Mode
  - Root cause: `onWindowFocusChanged` aggressively re-applied immersive mode, stealing focus back from the system power menu window
  - Additionally, `onResume` would re-trigger `startLockTask()` during the brief focus transition, compounding the issue
  - Fix: debounced `hideSystemUI()` by 600ms on focus regain, and deferred `startLockTask()` re-lock when power button is allowed and focus was recently lost
  - No security impact: Lock Task Mode remains fully active throughout — only the cosmetic immersive mode re-application is delayed
  - Affects TECNO, Infinix, itel (HiOS) and potentially other OEMs with aggressive WindowManager behavior on Android 14+
- 🐛 **Device Owner Status Hardcoded `false` in API**: Fixed `/api/info` and `/api/status` always reporting `isDeviceOwner: false`
  - Was hardcoded to `false` in `HttpServerModule.getDeviceStatus()`
  - Now performs a real `DevicePolicyManager.isDeviceOwnerApp()` check
  - This caused external dashboards to incorrectly show Device Owner as inactive
- 📺 **Screen On Not Working After lockNow()**: Fixed `GET /api/screen/on` failing when screen was off
  - `reactContext.currentActivity` was `null` after `lockNow()` and the code silently did nothing
  - WakeLock is now acquired **before** checking for activity (WakeLock works without activity)
  - Added keyguard dismissal to properly wake from locked state
  - Screen now reliably turns on whether activity is available or not
- 🧹 **Clear Cache Now Actually Clears**: Fixed `/api/clearCache` which only reloaded the WebView
  - Now performs a full native cache clear: WebView HTTP cache, cookies, Web Storage (localStorage/sessionStorage), form data
  - Then forces a WebView remount on the JS side for a complete fresh start
- 🔄 **In-App Update 404 Error**: Fixed update download failing with 404 error
  - Now retrieves actual APK download URL from GitHub release assets instead of constructing it
  - Eliminates filename case sensitivity issues (FreeKiosk vs freeKiosk)
  - More robust: works regardless of APK naming convention changes
  - Fallback to constructed URL if asset parsing fails
- 📸 **Screenshot Race Condition**: Fixed `/api/screenshot` returning 503 intermittently
  - Replaced `Thread.sleep(100)` with a proper `CountDownLatch` to wait for the UI thread
  - Screenshot capture now waits up to 5 seconds for the UI thread to complete

## [1.2.10] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- ⏱️ **Inactivity Return - Scroll to Top Toggle**: New optional behavior for when already on start page
  - Added "Scroll to Top on Start Page" toggle (enabled by default)
  - When enabled and already on start page, smoothly scrolls to top instead of doing nothing
- 🔗 **URL Filtering (Blacklist / Whitelist)**: Control which URLs users can navigate to within the kiosk WebView
  - Choose between **Blacklist** mode (block specific URLs) or **Whitelist** mode (allow only specific URLs)
  - Wildcard pattern support (e.g., `*.example.com/*`, `freekiosk.app/download`)
  - Patterns without protocol are automatically matched with `http://` and `https://`
  - Main kiosk URL is always protected and cannot be blocked
  - Empty whitelist = strictest mode (only main URL allowed)
  - Works with both traditional navigation and SPA/client-side routing (pushState)
  - Optional visual feedback toast when a URL is blocked
  - Popup/new window URLs are also filtered

### Fixed
- 🔗 **URL Filtering - Form Submits and JS Buttons**: Fixed form submissions and JavaScript buttons being blocked in whitelist mode
  - Filter now compares origin + pathname instead of just origin
  - Same-page navigations (query params, hash changes, form submits) are always allowed
  - Trailing slashes are normalized (e.g., `https://example.com` and `https://example.com/` are treated as identical)
  - Only navigation to different pages on the same domain requires whitelist match
- 📡 **NFC Monitoring Fix**: Fixed "flicking back to blue screen" when NFC is enabled in kiosk mode
  - Foreground monitoring detected transient `com.android.nfc` package as a wrong app and triggered a relaunch loop
  - NFC system package is now filtered from monitoring checks only when NFC mode is active
  - No impact on monitoring behavior when NFC is disabled
- 💾 **Backup/Restore Missing Settings**: Fixed 20 settings keys not being included in export/import backups
  - Added missing URL filtering settings (blacklist/whitelist lists and configuration)
  - Added missing screen scheduler, inactivity return, blocking overlays settings
  - Added missing WebView back button, camera position, return-to-settings preferences
  - PIN mode setting now properly backed up and restored

***

## [1.2.9] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- 📱 **Status Bar Rotation Fix**: Fixed custom status bar disappearing after screen rotation in external app mode
  - OverlayService now recreates the status bar overlay after configuration changes
  - MainActivity re-hides Android system bars on rotation to prevent them from reappearing
- 🔧 **Lock Mode "Device Owner not configured" False Warning**: Fixed JS bundle out of sync with native Kotlin module
  - `startLockTask` call in bundled JS had 2 parameters instead of 3 (missing `allowNotifications`)
  - React Native bridge could not match the method signature, causing a silent exception
  - Resulted in false "Device Owner not configured" warning even when Device Owner was properly set
- 🖱️ **5-Tap During Page Load**: Fixed 5-tap not working while WebView is loading or when page fails to load
  - Invisible touch zone in bottom-right corner during loading and error states
  - Tapping it counts as a 5-tap interaction, allowing access to settings even without network
  - Touch zone disappears automatically once the page loads successfully (JS-based detection takes over)

***

## [1.2.8] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- 🖨️ **WebView Print Support**: Native Android printing via `window.print()` interception
  - Supports all connected printers (WiFi, Bluetooth, USB, Cloud Print, PDF)
- 🔗 **URL Filtering (Blacklist / Whitelist)**: Control which URLs users can navigate to
  - Blacklist or Whitelist mode with wildcard pattern support
  - Works with traditional navigation and SPA/client-side routing
- ⬅️ **Back Button Mode via ADB**: `back_button_mode` parameter synced to native SharedPreferences
- ⚠️ **Usage Stats Permission Warning**: Permission check and grant button in Settings

### Fixed
- 🔧 **Back Button Fix**: Fixed back button completely blocked when `test_mode=false`
- 🔀 **ADB Config Fix**: `lock_package` now takes priority over `url` for display mode
-  **Auto Launch on Boot Fix**: Fixed wrong AsyncStorage database name in native Kotlin files
- 🔒 **Settings Buttons Fix**: Lock task temporarily stopped before opening system settings

***

## [1.2.7] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Navigation Buttons Blocked in Lock Mode**: Fixed navigation buttons (Home, Recents) not being properly blocked in kiosk lock mode
  - Ensured `LOCK_TASK_FEATURE_NONE` correctly blocks all system navigation by default
  - Only `GLOBAL_ACTIONS` (power button) and `NOTIFICATIONS` are conditionally enabled based on user settings
  - Updated `hideSystemUI()` to use modern `WindowInsetsController` API for Android 11+ (API 30+)
  - Added `SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LOW_PROFILE` fallback for older Android versions

***

## [1.2.6] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- 🔍 **Background App Monitoring**: Auto-relaunch monitoring service for External App mode
  - Automatically detects when locked app exits (crash, timeout, manual close)
  - Brings FreeKiosk back to foreground and relaunches the external app
  - Uses UsageStatsManager for accurate foreground detection (requires Device Owner or manual permission)
  - Monitoring activates when auto-relaunch is enabled in settings
  - Check every 2 seconds in background without impacting performance

### Fixed
- 🚀 **ADB Configuration Kiosk Mode**: Fixed kiosk mode not activating on first launch with `auto_start=true`
  - External app now launches AFTER kiosk mode is properly activated
  - Ensures lock task whitelist includes both FreeKiosk and external app before launch
  - Proper restart sequence: save config → restart FreeKiosk → activate kiosk → launch app
- 📡 **EXTERNAL_APP_LAUNCHED Broadcast**: Improved broadcast reliability for ADB monitoring
  - Now verifies app is in foreground before broadcasting (up to 10 retries over 5 seconds)
  - Adds `verified` boolean to broadcast extras to indicate foreground verification status
  - Consistent behavior whether launched via ADB auto_start or normal app flow
  - Better debugging with detailed logs showing retry attempts and current foreground app
- 🌐 **REST API Reboot Endpoint**: Fixed `/api/reboot` not executing the reboot
  - Reboot now runs natively via `DevicePolicyManager.reboot()` instead of through JS bridge
  - No longer depends on React Native bridge being active (works with screen off)
  - Returns clear error if app is not Device Owner
- 🔀 **REST API Method Handling**: Control endpoints now accept both GET and POST
  - Endpoints without body (`/api/screen/on`, `/api/reboot`, `/api/reload`, etc.) accept GET or POST
  - Endpoints requiring body (`/api/url`, `/api/tts`, `/api/brightness`, etc.) remain POST-only
  - Wrong method on POST-only endpoints now returns 405 "Method Not Allowed" instead of 404 "Not Found"

***

## [1.2.5] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- 📷 **Camera Photo API**: Take photos via REST endpoint using device cameras

  - Compatible with Home Assistant `camera` platform integration

### Fixed
- 🖼️ **Screensaver API State Separation**: Clarified screen status reporting in REST API
  - GET `/api/screen` now separates physical screen state from screensaver overlay state
  - `"on"`: Reports PHYSICAL screen state via PowerManager.isInteractive (true even if screensaver active)
  - `"screensaverActive"`: Separate boolean indicating if screensaver overlay is showing
  - Allows clients to distinguish: screen physically on vs content visible to user
- 🔢 **Version Reporting**: API now dynamically reads version from BuildConfig instead of hardcoded value
  - Automatically syncs with `versionName` in build.gradle
  - No more manual updates needed when version changes
  - Single source of truth for version information
- 🔐 **PIN Input Stability**: Completely refactored PIN masking system for universal device compatibility
  - Now uses native `secureTextEntry` instead of manual bullet masking
  - Fixes duplicate/random character issues on certain Android devices/keyboards
  - Eliminates input desynchronization problems
  - Adds autocomplete prevention (`autoComplete="off"`, `textContentType="none"`, `importantForAutofill="no"`)

***

## [1.2.4] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

***
## [1.2.2] - 2026-01-21

### Changed
- 🎯 **5-Tap Detection System**: Complete redesign for fullscreen detection
  - 5-tap now works **anywhere on the screen** (not just on button)
  - Tap 5 times rapidly anywhere to access settings - no more corner targeting required
  - Uses invisible 1x1 pixel overlay with `FLAG_WATCH_OUTSIDE_TOUCH` for fullscreen tap detection
  - Visual indicator is now optional (can be hidden but 5-tap still works everywhere)
  - Underlying app remains 100% interactive (no touch blocking)
  - Removed button position settings (visual indicator fixed in bottom-right when visible)
  - Same behavior in both WebView and External App modes

### Added
- 🔊 **Volume 5-Tap Gesture**: Alternative to 5tap for accessing PIN screen
  - Press Volume Up or Volume Down 5 times quickly to access settings
  - Works even when volume is at max (use Volume Down) or min (use Volume Up)
  - Only active when kiosk mode (lock task) is enabled
  - Toggle in Settings > Security > "Volume 5-Tap"
- 🎨 **Blocking Overlay**: Configurable overlay to block user interactions
  - Touch Logger countdown feature with coordinates display
  - Configurable via settings

### Fixed
- 🖥️ **Screen On/Off API**: Improved reliability for `/api/screen/on` and `/api/screen/off`
  - With Device Owner: uses `lockNow()` to truly turn off screen
  - Without Device Owner: improved brightness control (0 instead of 0.01)
  - Properly manages `FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON` flag
- 🔧 **React Native New Architecture**: Fixed compatibility issues with BroadcastReceivers
- 🐛 **Screensaver Wake**: Fixed screensaver not waking properly after touch or motion detection (stale closure issue)
- 🎨 **Visual Fixes**:
